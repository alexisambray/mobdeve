This is our version control repository for our application AnimoWaze for our course MOBDEVE.
Developed by Reece de Padua | Alexis Ambray | AY Term 2 2022-2023


Animo Waze is an app designed to help La Sallians become familiar with the DLSU campus like its buildings, rooms, and 
restos surrounding the campus. It provides location services for students who are lost and unfamiliar with the places, 
especially those who are new to the onsite setup. It will guide students with the places around campus that offer 
good services such as places conducive for studying, eating, or meetings. Other than location services, the app will also 
include place reviews where students can rate and give comments on the problems that they encounter for the facilities of DLSU 
and even restos based on their negative or positive experiences with the place.
